                <p>It was a brief orbital talent show.</p>
                <p>“Hayley is a champ at spinning,” Sian Proctor, one of the four private citizens currently orbiting Earth
                    inside SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule, said of her crew mate Hayley Arceneaux, who was somersaulting in
                    the weightlessness of space on camera. “She’s been spinning ever since we got on orbit.”

                <p>Christopher Sembroski, another crew mate, whipped out a ukulele and threatened to play it live on camera
                    to over 55,000 viewers on SpaceX’s live YouTube stream — “You can turn your volume down if you wish, but
                    I’ll give it a shot.” He did a little riff while Arceneaux was holding the mic, and it wasn’t half bad.
                    “It’s still before coffee, so it’ll get better before the day goes on.”

                    Proctor showed off a drawing she made using a pack of metallic pens that depicted the Crew Dragon
                    capsule blasting off Earth and leaving a trail of exhaust that looks like a dragon. “I have really
                    enjoyed learning how to use markers in space,” she said.

                    The four-person Inspiration4 crew, which includes billionaire entrepreneur and the mission’s funder
                    Jared Isaacman, has been zipping around the planet 15 times a day since Wednesday night, when they
                    <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675793/spacex-inspiration4-launch-first-all-civilian-private-crew">
                        blasted to space on top of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket from Florida
                    </a>. Friday afternoon, they gave their first update on what they’ve been up to in a live YouTube video
                    nearly two days after lifting off the lack of public communication itself an indicator that space is no
                    longer just for government astronauts, who are typically far more transparent.
                </p>
                <p>Proctor, Arceneaux, Sembroski and Isaacman represent the first fully private contingent of humans to
                    enter orbit without the aegis of professionally trained astronauts. They also represent the inaugural
                    private crew flown by SpaceX, which has flown just three crews of government astronauts before.
                </p>
                <p>“We’re really proud to share this experience with everyone, we know how fortunate we are to be up here,”
                    Isaacman said on camera. “We’re giving all of our time to science research and some ukulele-playing, and
                    trying to raise some good awareness for an important cause back on Earth.”
                </p>
                <p>Unlike Crew Dragon flights for government astronauts, who trek to the International Space Station, the
                    Inspiration4’s spacecraft came equipped with a glass dome installed where Crew Dragon’s docking door
                    would normally be. Proctor held the camera up to the dome, which appeared big enough to easily fit the
                    upper torsos of three people. Facing Earth, it was dark outside, and the live camera feed was choppy and
                    pixelated, but the crew could see the array of night lights dotting Earth’s surface. “Ooh, that looks
                    like the aurora!” Proctor said. “Oh wow.”

                            had an incredible first day in space! They’ve completed more than 15 orbits around planet Earth
                            since liftoff and made full use of the Dragon cupola.

                    Aside from the milestones, the Inspiration4 mission is primarily a massive fundraising event for St.
                    Jude Children’s Hospital, a non-profit that conducts cancer research and gives free care to kids with
                    cancer. The goal is $200 million; Isaacman donated the first $100 million and paid for the crew’s seats
                    for an undisclosed amount. The rest is being raised through various efforts: some of the items the crew
                    took with them to space — like hops for beer, NFTs, pieces of art, and stuffed animals — are supported
                    by sponsorships from companies that have committed thousands in donations to St. Jude or will be
                    <a href="https://www.charitybuzz.com/support/StJude">auctioned off once back on Earth</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The crew also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xnBajP0Kus&t=1s">video chatted with St. Jude
                        patients </a>
                    and <a href="https://twitter.com/NYSE/status/1438960197666578435?s=20">rang the bell</a> on the New York
                    Stock Exchange (Isaacman’s payment-processing company, Shift4 Payments, is publicly traded).
                    Isaacman <a href="https://twitter.com/BetMGM/status/1438607327201013765?s=20">placed a $4,000 bet</a>
                    to Las Vegas that the Eagles would win the Super Bowl. In the live video, Arceneaux showed
                    off a
                    device the crew is using to measure cranial pressure as part of a scientific study to monitor how their
                    bodies behave in microgravity.

                    The Inspiration4 mission is expected to last about three days. They’ll reenter Earth’s atmosphere and
