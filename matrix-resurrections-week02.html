                        The Matrix Resurrections
                    </a> is coming in a trailer this Thursday, September 9 – and the
                    movie has brought back the classic WhatIsTheMatrix.com website to offer teaser videos featuring first
                    movie footage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first trailer will be dropped at 6am Pacific / 9am Eastern / 2pm UK / 11pm AEST, and you can expect
                    it to feature some or all of what we heard coming out from CinemaCon last month. The

                    is being suppressed by daily intake of blue pills, a possible appearance from a young Morpheus, and the
                    series' requisite martial arts action.

                    The unexpected return of <a href="https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/">WhatIsTheMatrix.com</a>
                    is offering generated teaser videos to those that visit, including the first footage of the film,
                    narration from the stars, and a choice between red and blue pills. Heading to the website and picking a
                    pill will generate one of what Warner Bros. says are 180,000 possible teaser videos for the movie, every
                    one of which will include film footage and narration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For those that don't remember, WhatIsTheMatrix.com was the website that launched with the original
                    Matrix movie and included multiple hidden pages accessed by codes, as well as games and comics based on
                    the film. It was an early experiment into viral web marketing for a film – the new take on the old site
                    launches into a very different internet landscape.
